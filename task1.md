## **Task 1**:
### Organise yourself into groups of _4-5_ people. Take up a team name, decide a team leader, choose a process and then, make an algorithm according to it. Also, make a flowchart for the same. If you would like, you can also send me a C code for the same process.
F.A.Q
1. Which process do we have to decide? 
	Ans. It can be any process in the world, you can decide it on your own.
2. What should be the next step once we decide the process?
	 Ans. The next step, would be to derive a problem statement from the process.
3. I/we do not have a computer/laptop, how are we to complete the task? 
	Ans. Take help from your team members, if you are not able to provide support with a computer/laptop, try to be present in the solving the problem on paper. Take active part in discussions and meetings. You can also use the labs with prior permission from your class advisor.
4. Is this task optional? 
	Ans. No, apart from other 'mini'-tasks that I assign to you in the classroom, this task is not optional. This is only the first task, you should expect more tasks like this in the future.
5. Is it really necessary to send an image file (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp, .pdf) for the flowchart? 
	Ans. No, it is not necessary, however, I would appreciate it if you do. An easy way to do this is via www.draw.io . It is completely okay, if you send me a photograph of the flowchart of the process after drawing it on a piece of paper.
6. What is the learning outcome of this task?
	Ans. After completing this task, you would be able to 
	-	Identify processes in the real world.
	-	Derive problem statements from the processes.
	-	Create algorithms to complete a process.
	-	Create flowcharts for an algorithm.
	This whole process will allow you to get a better picture of the whole coding process as well as give you a flavour of how it is like 
	working in a team with fellow member inside a timeline.
With all that being said, I hope this will be a wonderful experience for all of you. I hope you learn something new :)
